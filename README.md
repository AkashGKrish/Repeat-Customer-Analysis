# Repeat-Customer-Analysis

Build a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of a customer making another transaction within two months of the latest transaction. Propose how you would deploy the model into a production environment and monitor its performance.

## Go through these basic steps

1. data profiling, preprocessing, and feature engineering
2. model building and evaluation - compare two different models using appropriate metrics
3. model optimisation - optimise the better-performing model
4. strategy for production deployment and monitoring
5. strategy for maintenance - updating the model as new data becomes available
